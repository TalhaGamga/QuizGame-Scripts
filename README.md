Scripts of my quiz game.

Concept: 

This is a quiz game, players try to know the questions from LLM. In the questions they think they don't know, the player is given another chance to not fall behind in this struggle and shoots one of the random options. If the other player has advanced to the shot answer, they cannot get points even though they know the question correctly. Other than that, there is no point gain for shooting the opponent. In order to win the game, you need to collect points by knowing the question.

Here is a video to see details.
